# FRW_Metric_In_Mathematica
My approach in computing Riemannian curvature family of FRW-metrics in Mathematica.
It can be used for computing the Levi-Civita, Riemannian, Ricci and Scalar curvatures for any  other Riemannian metric also. 
Lie Bracket on the tangent bundle as a certain form of Dot product is reviewed. So, one can compute all of the objects living on the space. Any lift could be adapted to the basic functions and so generalized.
